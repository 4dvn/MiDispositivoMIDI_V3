# Examples

This section contains a list of examples for MiDispositivoMIDI that can be loaded to your device. Feel free to experiment! Some important notes about the examples
* Some examples use our Arduino library, others they don't.
* All examples are targeted to MiDispositivoMIDI V3, but note that there are several different configurations. Most of the codes will be ok for one MiDisopsitivoMIDI, but if you connect more than one, that code might not be valid.
* Have a new cool feature? Feel free to send us a pull request with some description of it, or maybe with a nice video!
