 * Hardware: One 4x4 board                                          *
 * Brief:    This code handles a MiDispositivoMIDI V3 with three    *
 *           expansions, which is, four devices in total. They have *
 *           to be connected in a 4x4, creating an array of 16      *
 *           buttons. With this code you can set a default color    *
 *           when the button is an idle state, and another color    *
 *           when the button is pushed. There is also a subroutine  *
 *           that does some animation with the leds.                *
 *                                                                  *
