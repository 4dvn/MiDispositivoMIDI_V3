TODO:
Move here all the content that is not related to the library.

According to the doc:
An extras folder can be used by the developer to put documentation or other items to be bundled with the library. Remember that files placed inside this folder will increase the size of the library, so putting a 20MB PDF in a library that weights a few kilobytes may not be such a good idea.

The content of the extras folder is totally ignored by the IDE; you are free to put anything inside such as supporting documentation, etc.
